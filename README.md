# Department-of-Defence-Nested-If-

The department of Defense would like a program that identifies candidates
between ages of 18 and 26, inclusive. Only do this  using nested if 
statement whose conditions test the next criterion only if all previous criteria tested 
were satisfied. ( E.g: If a candidates age is 20 years old and he directly puts this age in the program
it will give an error. The program will identify that candidate is eligible when he passes the previous 
criterion. )

Word Problem
Solve only using (Nested if) "arrays pointers or any thing loops are not allowed".
